# 3-days-of-Angular-magic

This training is addressed to everyone who wants to use Angular magic to build a Single Page Application.

By understanding the theory and solving the exercises from each day, you will be introduced in the basics of Angular.

We will develop together, depending on our knowledge,  during the 3 days:

- a functional Personal Travelling Blog where we can display all the blog articles and allow the user to execute CRUD operations on them. Also, we have an article details page where we can read the whole article. We will follow the [Blog design and requirements](Design/Blog/README.md) to make our application user-friendly.

- or a functional Forex trading application meant to help us to buy and sell currencies and also to view all transactions (made by us or by other users). We will follow the [Fx trading design and requirements](Design/Fx-trading/README.md) to make our application user-friendly.
